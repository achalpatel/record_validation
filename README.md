# record_validation
A record validation application on ethereum blockchain

Hello,
Our Web application provides service to validate an academic record. Currently, we are using Metamask to manage our accounts and we have developed on Ropsten test network.

What you need to install:
1. First you will need to have npm installed to use web3 instance. Refer my repository to install npm - https://github.com/achalpatel/npm_web3js
2. Currently, we have used Xampp server. Our code includes php file.
3. After cloning the repository, make sure to create "uploads" directory in your project's root directory. The file you upload, will be saved in uploads folder and used by the python script to produce hash.
4. You will need to set up a Metamask account and select the Ropsten Test Network as the provider. Then get some faucet ethers from there.
